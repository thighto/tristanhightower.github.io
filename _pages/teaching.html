  Believing that teaching is an ever-evolving practice, I regularly participate in pedagogical training, consultations, and initiatives to promote effective instruction. Some recent activities have included:
  <ul>
  <li> Assisting in the development of a database of resources for faculty at Bryant about teaching before, during, and after the 2024 election with several colleagues and the <a href="https://cte.bryant.edu/election-teaching/">Center for Teaching Excellence</a>.</li>
  <li> Co-authoring a guide to best practices on political discussion in the classroom.</li>  
  <li> Coordinating a speaker series to give students the opportunity to hear and learn from scholars who study underrepresented minorities.</li>

  </ul>
