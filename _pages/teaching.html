I consider teaching to be a great privilege and always enjoy the opportunity to interact with students.
  My teaching philosophy centers on 1) experimenting with ways to enhance the pedagogical experience and 2)
  making every effort to get students as interested in the material as I am. 
  I have consistently been ranked in the top percentiles
  of student evaluations at the department, college, and University levels. For a copy of my evaluations,
  please <a href="mailto:thighto@umd.edu?">contact me</a>. In 2020, I was recognized by the College of Behavioral and Social
  Science with their <a href="https://bsos.umd.edu/graduate/excellence-teaching">Excellence in Teaching Award</a>. I have served as a teaching assistant for the following courses:
<ul>
<li>GVPT 202: Politics, Constitutional Policy, and the Institution of the U.S. Supreme Court (Patrick Wohlfarth, Primary Instructor), 
  Spring 2019.</li>
  <li>GVPT 473: The U.S. Congress (Ric Uslaner, Primary Instructor), Fall 2018.</li>
