I have worked as a teaching assistant for two courses:
<ul>
<li>GVPT 202: Politics, Constitutional Policy, and the Institution of the U.S. Supreme Court (Patrick Wohlfarth, Primary Instructor), 
  Spring 2019.</li>
  <li>GVPT 473: The U.S. Congress (Ric Uslaner, Primary Instructor), Fall 2018.</li>
</ul>
For both courses, I was the highest ranked teaching assistant in the department based on aggregate course evaluation scores.
I also ranked in the top percentiles in the college and university. If you would like a copy of my course evaluations, please
