My main field of research is American politics with a secondary concentration in methodology. I am broadly interested in American political institutions -- especially the U.S. Congress and interest groups. My current research agenda is pointed toward better understanding religious representation from an institutional perspective. I am also collaborating with <a href="https://gvpt.umd.edu/facultyprofile/gimpel/james">Jim Gimpel</a> and <a href="https://gvpt.umd.edu/facultyprofile/wohlfarth/patrick-c">Patrick Wohlfarth</a> on a paper examining the emergence of redistricting litigation. It will be presented at MPSA in 2020. If you would like to know more about my current research, please feel free to <a href="mailto:thighto@umd.edu">contact me</a>.

I currently have one publication that was adapted from my undergraduate thesis:

<a href="https://trace.tennessee.edu/pursuit/vol9/iss1/4/">Hightower, Tristan M. 2019. “Tennessee’s Promise: Education for All?” <i>Pursuit – The Journal of Undergraduate Research at the University of Tennessee</i> 9(1), Article 4.</a>
