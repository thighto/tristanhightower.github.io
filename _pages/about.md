Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Department of Government and Politics at the University of Maryland (Go Terps!). My primary subfield is American Politics with specific interests in Congress, interest groups, and polarization. Before starting graduate school at Maryland, I graduated Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science. I am also a graduate of the Chancellor’s Honors Program at UT. Outside of academia, I have interned for a U.S. Senator’s field office and on the Hill for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
